                    What our clients typically want to know...
                </h2>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    What is Etarget's role? Are you looking to replace our creative or media agency?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    No, our role is to complement the triangle of advertiser, creative agency, and media agency by
                    providing specific skills, experience, and tools to improve the effectiveness of non-video display
                    advertising (banners), ensuring better results.
                    Typically, our business partner is the media agency, though in some cases, we work directly with the
                    advertiser.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    As a media agency, we are often not allowed to change banners provided by the advertiser.
                    Can I still use Etarget's services?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Yes. It is possible to preserve the creative concept, design, messaging, and brand guidelines while
                    adapting the ad format for maximum effectiveness. We typically develop multiple ad format versions
                    with varying levels of adaptation and predict their impact to make decision-making by the brand
                    manager simple and goal-oriented.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    Can we just use the adapted ad format from Etarget and handle the media buying ourselves via DSP
                    or direct purchase?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Yes, we can provide the adapted ad format as a standard third-party tag, which you can implement in
                    your platform. Etarget will then handle the ad serving and campaign measurement.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    Is your ad serving compatible with programmatic platforms?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Yes, our adapted ads work across all major DSPs, and we are certified for Google 360.
                </div>


                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    Can I measure the campaign with tools other than Etarget?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Yes, we are happy to implement any third-party measurement solutions as required.
                </div>


                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    What’s the difference between running the entire campaign through Etarget or using our own
                    platforms?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    The simple answer is our experience in optimization for attention and engagement. The advantage of
                    buying through Etarget is that we have over 3 years of specialized experience in this type of
                    optimization, supported by proprietary data, trained staff, and established best practices. We also
                    guarantee standard KPIs such as minimum viewability, brand safety, and CTR. For targeting, we use
                    standard audiences provided by third parties.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    Will Etarget ad formats work reliably in a programmatic environment?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Yes, our solution is designed from the outset to work reliably in a programmatic environment without
                    requiring any special technical setup from the ad network or publisher.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    What data does Etarget provide, and how is reporting handled?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Clients have access to real-time data via the Etarget online platform (also available via API),
                    which includes all parameters needed to evaluate the campaign from an attention and engagement
                    perspective. Additionally, after each campaign, the client receives a detailed report that can be
                    easily incorporated into the overall campaign summary.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    What is the process for ordering a campaign and how long does it take?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    After receiving the brief and necessary materials, creating the ad formats for the campaign takes
                    8-10 days, though this can be significantly shortened if needed. The ad format is then reviewed by
                    the client, and based on feedback, it is finalized within 1-2 days, making it ready for deployment.
                    <br><br>
                    If the brief also includes media buying, we can deliver a proposal within a few hours after
                    receiving specifications for the target audience, media space quality, or other parameters.
                </div>

                <h3 class="second-heading">
                    Can Etarget predict the expected campaign results before it launches?
                </h3>

                <div class="text-regular">
                    Thanks to years of experience running campaigns optimized for attention and engagement, we can
                    estimate the required parameters with high accuracy before the campaign starts, despite the
                    diversity of products and ad formats.
